# HTML

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It used to build the content.

## The structure

## Extra Markup

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
  *For version HTML5*   `<!DOCTYPE html>`

* You can add comments to your code -that will not be visible in the user's browser- , you can add the text between these characters:
  `<!-- comment goes here -->`

* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
`<p id="pullquote"> the paragragh </p>`

`<p class="important">    </p>`

* The `<div>` and `<span>` elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

* `<iframes>` cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.

*example:*

`<iframe`
`width="450"`
`height="350"`
`src="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=moma+new+york&amp;output=embed">`
`</iframe>`


* The `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.

## HTML5 Layout

- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.


## Process & Design

* It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.



# JavaScript


| Word  | Definition |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| A script |  is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal |
| Vocabulary  | The words that computers understand   |
| Syntax  | How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow  |

## WRITING A SCRIPT

Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.


### DEFINE THE GOAL

 First, you need to define the task you want to achieve.


### DESIGN THE SCRIPT

To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task programmatically. (You need to learn to "think" like a computer)

### CODE EACH STEP

Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.


## EXPRESSIONS

An expression evaluates into a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
1.	**EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE** In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign).

 `var color = 'beige';` *The value of color is now beige.*

2.	**EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE** You can perform operations on any number of individual values (see next page) to determine a single value.
 For example: `var area = 3 * 2;`  *The value of area is now 6.*


### OPERATORS

Expressions rely on things called *operators*; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
1. **ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS** Assign a value to a variable

    `color = 'beige';`   *The value of color is now beige.*

1. **ARITHMETIC OPERATORS** Perform basic math 

    `area = 3 * 2;`   *The value of area is now 6*. 

1. **STRING OPERATORS** Combine two strings 

    `greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';`    *The value of greeting is now Hi Molly.*

1. **COMPARISON OPERATORS** Compare two values and return true or false

    `buy = 3 > 5;`   *The value of buy is false.*

1. **LOGICAL OPERATORS** Combine expressions and return true or false

    `buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);`   *The value of buy is now true.*
