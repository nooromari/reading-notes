## Lists

### There are three types of HTML lists: 

    1. Ordered. `<ol>` 
    2. Unordered. `<ul>`
    3. Definition. `<dl>`

- *Ordered* lists use numbers [1,2,3....].
- *Unordered* lists use bullets [Â°] .
- *Definition* lists are used to define  terminology .
- Lists can be nested inside one another.
- For nested list you can put a second list inside `<li>` element to create a sub-list or nested list.


## Boxes

- You can use CSS to control the dimensions [border, padding, margin] .

    * The **margin** property controls the gap/. between boxes.
    * The **padding** is the space appear between the content of an element and its border.
    * The **border** is  the edge of one box from another.

- You can also control the borders, margin and paddling. 
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

## JS Arrays:

An array is a special type of variable that stores a list of values.

*Syntax:*

`var array_name = [item1, item2, ...];`    

*Example:*

`var names = ['noor','batool','sara'];`   *array literal*

**or**

`var names = new Array ('noor','batool','sara');`   *array constructor*


### Switch:

switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).

*Syntax:*

`switch(expression) {`
 ` case x:`
  `  // code block`
   ` break;`
  `case y:`
   ` // code block`
    `break;`
  `default:`
   ` // code block`
`}`
