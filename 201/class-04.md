## Links

Links allow users to click their way from page to page. They are created by using the <a> element and the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to, like below:

### Absolute and Relative URLs:

- Absolute URL: a full web address.

- Relative URL: A local link (a link to a page within the same website) *without the "https://www" part*.

  * If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.



- You can create links to open email programs with an email address. The href attribute starts with `mailto:` and is followed by the email address you want the
email to be sent to.

*Example:*
`<a href="mailto:email@example.jo">`


### Target:

If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening <a> tag. The value of this attribute should be `_blank`.

*Example:*
`<a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">`

* You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

*Example:*
`<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>`


## Layout

**Block-level** boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout(such as `<h1>` `<li>` ), while **Inline** boxes flow between surrounding text (such as `<img>` ).


### Containing Elements:

The containing or *parent* element is the outer box which contain a block-level element sits inside another block-level element. It is common to group a number of elements together inside a <div> (or other block-level) element.

### Controlling the Position

CSS has allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

1. **Normal flow**: Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one. This is the default behavior.

2. **Relative Positioning**: This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow. This
does not affect the position of surrounding elements.

3. **Absolute positioning**: This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow.Absolutely positioned elements move as users scroll up and down the page.

- To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use **box offset** properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.


## Function

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task and it is executed when calls it(*invokes*).

- You can invokes the function by use the function name followed by parentheses.
- If the function have *parameters* when it is invoked it should have *arguments* (the values received by the function).
- When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
