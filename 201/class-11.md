## Images

The HTML `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in a web page. It is an empty tag (does not have a closing tag).

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

- src - Specifies the path to the image
- alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image

*Syntax:*
`<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">`

### Three Rules for Creating Images:

1. Save images in the right format: Websites mainly use images in *jpeg, gif, or png*.

2. Save images at the right size: You should save the image at the same width and height it will appear on the website.

3. Use the correct resolution Computer screens are made up of dots known as *pixels*. Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.

- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.


## Practical Information

- Search engine optimization helps visitors find your sites when using search engines.

- Analytics tools such as **Google Analytics** allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.

- To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.

- FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.

- Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch).


## Video and Audio

The `<video>` and `<audio>` elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages. 

- **HTMLMediaElement** API provides features to allow you to control video and audio players such as `HTMLMediaElement.play()` and `HTMLMediaElement.pause()`.
