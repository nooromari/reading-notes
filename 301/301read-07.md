## REST

**REST**: is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. 


***Requests***

- REST requires that when a client make a request then the data will modify on the server. 
- The request can be initiated by calling the method on the request object (generally `.get()`)
