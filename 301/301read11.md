# EJS

**EJS:** is a template system compatible with Express for back-end use as it hooks into the View engine architecture that Express provides and lets you render web pages to the client with `res.render()` in Express.

   * You define HTML pages in the EJS syntax and you specify where various data will go in the page. Then, your app combines data with the template and "renders" a complete HTML page where EJS takes your data and inserts it into the web page according to how you've defined the template.
