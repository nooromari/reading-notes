*We need to loads jQuery from a CDN by write `<script>` tags inside html file before the body close tag.*


## Events

- jQuery makes handle events easier because the event methods work across all browsers.

**JQUERY EVENTS**

- To add an event you can use `.on()` method (for one or more event).
- To remove event you can use `.off()` method.

**Example:**

`$('img').on('click', function(){`

`  alert('You click on the image');`

`});`
