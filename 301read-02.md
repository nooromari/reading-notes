## jQuery

- jQuery: is a javascript file that you include in your web pages it lets you find elements using CSS selectors and do something with the elements using jQuery methods. Is achieve a variety of common JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently.

- we can select object by this `$('ul.ul1')` in this way we can select class for ul.

`//script code scope`
`});`

- `.html` : is to decleare element.
- `.text` : is to make text or paragraph (not contain any tags).

- When a page loads jQuery from a CDN, It starts with a `<script>` tag that tries to load the jQuery file. This is known as a protocol relative URL. This is often followed by a second `<script>` tag that
contains a logical operator, which checks to see if jQuery has loaded.

*Write it inside html file before the body close tag:*

`<script src=" //ajax .googl eapi s . com/ ajax/l i bs/ jquery / 1.10 . 2/ jquery .min. js "></ script>`
`<script>window .jQuery 11 document. write (' <script src=" j s/j query- 1.10. 2 . j s 11><\jscri pt> ' )</script>`



## Events

- Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a button has been clicked).
- jQuery makes it easier to handle events because the event methods work across all browsers.
