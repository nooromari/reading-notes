# Flexbox and Templating

## Javascript Templating

Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source.

### Mustache

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.
It is often referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements.

Mustache is a specification for a templating language. In general, we would write templates according to the Mustache specification, and it can then be compiled by a templating engine to be rendered to create an output.

## Flexbox

The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space.


- `justify-content`: It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size.  

- `flex-start`: items packed to the start of the container. The (more supported) flex-start honors the.
- `flex-end`: items packed to the end of the container. The (more support) flex-end honors the flex-direction while end honors the writing-mode direction.
- `center`: items centered in the container.
- `space-between`: items evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end
- `space-around`: items evenly distributed with equal space around each line.
