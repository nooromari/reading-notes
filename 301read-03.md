# Flexbox and Templating

## Javascript Templating

Javascript templating: is a technique use to render client-side view templates with Javascript in fast and efficient way.

### Mustache

**Mustache**: is a logic-less template syntax (means that it doesn’t rely on procedural statements like if statment). It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything also it is implemented in different languages. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

## Flexbox

The flex layout use to give the container the ability to alter its items width, height and order to best fill the available space.


- `justify-content`: Property use for distribute extra free space when the flex items are inflexible, or have reached maximum size.  

*We can use it with these values:*

- `flex-start`: items packed to the start of the container. 
- `flex-end`: items packed to the end of the container.
- `center`: items centered in the container.
- `space-between`: items evenly distributed (Which mean the first item will be at the start of the container while the last one is at the end).
- `space-around`: items evenly distributed with equal space around each line.
