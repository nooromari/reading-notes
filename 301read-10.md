# The Call Stack 

A call stack is a mechanism which track with function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function. *It can only do one thing at a time(single-threaded)*.


- The compiler adds the finction called to the call set and then begins performing the function.
- Any other functions called by this function are added to the call stack.
- The compiler pulls it out when the current job ends.
- The "Stack Overflow" error caused when the stack takes more space than it is assigned to .
