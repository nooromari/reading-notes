# Sending Form Data

  The client (web browser) sends a request to the server using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol. The data sends to the server from the forms; `<form>` element defines how the data will be sent(*the data always will sent as a list of key/value pairs*).  
  
* The two most important attributes are **action** and **method**. 


  - The action attribute defines where the data gets sent.  

  - The method attribute defines how data is sent.
  
      - *GET method*: the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.
      - *POST method*: the data provided in the body of the HTTP request.
