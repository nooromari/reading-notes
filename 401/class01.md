## Python variables

- **rebinding**: creates an entirely new object, and then the assignment statement makes x refer to it.

*assignment never makes new values, and it never copies data*


- Appending to num is **mutating** num. The name num still refers to the same object, but that object has been modified.

*There is no way to mutate a number. They are immutable, literally they cannot be mutated.*
