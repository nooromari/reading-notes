# Test

## Unit tests and TDD:
Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.
 - When we are writing tests we are forced to think about the design first and how we can break it into small pieces.

# Recursion

**Recursion**: The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.
