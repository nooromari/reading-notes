## Dunder Methods

 - Dunder Methods: are the special methods that start and end with the double underscores. They are also called **Magic methods**. They are not meant to be invoked directly by you, but the invocation happens internally from the class on a certain action.

 - For example, when you add two numbers using the + operator, internally, the __add__() method will be called.

- *“dunder methods”, a short form of “double under.”*

## Statistics — Probability

- At the most basic level, probability seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?” An event is some outcome of interest. To calculate the chance of an event happening, we also need to consider all the other events that can occur.

- To calculate the probability of an event occurring, we count how many times are event of interest can occur (say flipping heads) and dividing it by the sample space. 

- We can use statistics to calculate probabilities based on observations from the real world and check how it compares to the ideal.
