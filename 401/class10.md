## Stacks and Queues

### What is a Stack ?
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

**Common terminology for a stack:**

| Term      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Push | Nodes that are put into the stack |
| Pop | Nodes that are removed from the stack |
| Top | This is the top of the stack |
| Peek | view the value of the top Node in the stack. |
| IsEmpty | returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false. |


*Stacks follow these concepts:*
- FILO : First In Last Out
- LIFO : Last In First Out

### What is a Queue ?

**Common terminology for a queue:**

| Term      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Enqueue | Nodes that are put into the queue |
| Dequeue | Nodes that are removed from the queue |
| Front | This is the front/first Node of the queue. |
| Rear | This is the rear/last Node of the queue. |
| Peek | view the value of the top Node in the queue. |
| IsEmpty | returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false. |

*Queues follow these concepts:*
- FIFO : First In First Out
- LILO : Last In Last Out
