- JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.

- You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters. Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing.

- JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats. JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.) and can also display rich kernel output in these formats. See File and Output Formats for more information.


## Numby

- NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem.

- You can check the number of rows and columns in our data using the `shape` property of NumPy arrays.

- You can also create an array where each element is a random number using `numpy.random.rand`. *can be useful when you want to quickly test your code with sample arrays.*

- Itâ€™s possible to use NumPy to directly read csv or other files into arrays. We can do this using the `numpy.genfromtxt` function.
