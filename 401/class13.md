## Linear Regression

- you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related. For example, you can use it to determine if and to what extent the experience or gender impact salaries.

- Regression is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors. For example, you could try to predict electricity consumption of a household for the next hour given the outdoor temperature, time of day, and number of residents in that household.


### Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is the simplest case of linear regression with a single independent variable.

- you can use scikit learn to perform linear regression. **Scikit-learn** is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction. Today, I will explore the sklearn.linear_model module which contains “methods intended for regression in which the target value is expected to be a linear combination of the input variables”.
