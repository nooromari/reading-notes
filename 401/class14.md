## Data Visualization

### Matplotlib package

- **Matplotlib** is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats. We are going to explore matplotlib in interactive mode covering most common cases.

- Matplotlib comes with a set of default settings that allow customizing all kinds of properties. You can control the defaults of almost every property in matplotlib: figure size and dpi, line width, color and style, axes, axis and grid properties, text and font properties and so on.

*example:*

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
ax.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [10, 20, 25, 30], color='lightblue', linewidth=3)
ax.scatter([0.3, 3.8, 1.2, 2.5], [11, 25, 9, 26], color='darkgreen', marker='^')
ax.set_xlim(0.5, 4.5)
plt.show()
```
