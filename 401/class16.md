## Machine Learning 

- **Machine learning** is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.

- This data science primer will cover:
   - exploratory analysis. 
   - data cleaning, 
   - feature engineering, 
   - algorithm selection.
   - model training. 

*As you can see, those chunks make up 80% of the pie. They also set the foundation for more advanced techniques.*


### Key Terminology

- Model - a set of patterns learned from data.
- Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.
- Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.
- Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.
- Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.
- Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.
- Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.


### Machine Learning Tasks

- In applied machine learning, you should first pick the right machine learning task for the job (A task is a specific objective for your algorithms).

1. Supervised Learning : includes tasks for "labeled" data (i.e. you have a target variable).

2. Unsupervised Learning : includes tasks for "unlabeled" data (i.e. you do not have a target variable).
