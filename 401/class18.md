## Cryptography

**Cryptography** is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it


- **Encryption** is the method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning.
- **Decryption** is taking encoded or encrypted text or other data and converting it back into text you or the computer can read and understand.
- **Cracking** uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.
