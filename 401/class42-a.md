## Ethics in the workplace

If you write code for a living, there’s a chance that at some point in your career, someone will ask you to code something a little deceitful – if not outright unethical. As developers, we are often one of the last lines of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices.
The more software continues to take over every aspect of our lives, the more important it will be for us to take a stand and ensure that our ethics are ever-present in our code. I have to think about the effects of my code before I write it.

## Ethics in Technology

Big Data is a civil rights issue, but it’s one that society in general is ill-equipped to deal with. The only way to deal with this properly is to somehow link what the data is with how it can be used. Tying data to permissions can be done through encryption or it can be done through legislation. But governments need to balance reliance on data with checks and balances about how this reliance erodes privacy and creates civil and moral issues we haven’t thought through.
